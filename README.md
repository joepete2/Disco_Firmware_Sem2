# Disco_Firmware_Sem2

Project Overview

This project contains firmware for the STM32H745i-DISCO evaluation board, which features a dual-core STM32H745XI microcontroller. The primary goal of the firmware is to control various peripherals and features of the microcontroller, with the codebase organized in a modular fashion for easier development and maintenance.

The firmware provides functionality for several different tasks, such as communication via UART, SPI, and I2C, as well as GPIO control, interrupt handling, and more. The main.c file serves as the entry point for the firmware, containing the initialization and control logic for the microcontroller and its peripherals.
Features

    Initialization of the microcontroller and its clocks
    Configuration and setup of GPIOs
    Initialization and setup of various peripherals such as UART, SPI, I2C, etc.
    Interrupt management and handling
    User-defined control loop for application-specific tasks
    Support for the dual-core nature of STM32H745XI microcontroller
    Customizable hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for easy porting to other platforms

File: main.c

The main.c file, located in the CM7/Core/Src/ directory, is the main entry point of the firmware. It includes the following key processes:

    System initialization: Sets up the microcontroller's clock and initializes the necessary peripherals.
    GPIO configuration: Configures the GPIO pins for their respective functions.
    Peripheral initialization: Initializes the required peripherals (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.) and sets up their respective interrupt handlers.
    User-defined control loop: Executes application-specific tasks in the main control loop.

Dependencies

    STM32H7xx HAL libraries
    CMSIS libraries
    Peripheral configuration files generated by STM32CubeMX

Building the Project

To build the project, you will need a compatible ARM GCC toolchain and the STM32CubeMX software to generate the required configuration files. Follow these steps:

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/joepete2/Disco_Firmware_Sem2.git

    Generate the peripheral configuration files using STM32CubeMX by opening the .ioc file located in the project directory and generating the code.

    Build the project using the provided Makefile or your preferred build system.

Flashing the Firmware

To flash the firmware onto your STM32H745i-DISCO evaluation board, you can use STM32CubeProgrammer or any other compatible flashing tool.
